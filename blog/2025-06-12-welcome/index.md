🚀 Introducing Silva Protocol: Finality-as-a-Service (FaaS) for Ethereum's future!  

Providing fast & secure finality layer for: 
✅ Integrated rollups (L2s) 
✅ Bridged external chains

The endgame for scalability & interoperability.

🔒 Ethereum’s scaling isn’t just about throughput — it’s about finality delay and omnichain interoperability.

7-day fraud proofs? 12s block times? Need 3rd-party bridges? ❌
Ivy Protocol: A native finality layer for Ethereum, delivering:
✅ ~1s deterministic finality for rollups
✅ Omnichain state relay for verifiable interoperability without new trust assumptions
