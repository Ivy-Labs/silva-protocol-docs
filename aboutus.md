# About Us
We are silva Labs â€” a team of blockchain-native geeks obsessed with decentralized systems, cryptography, and smart contract innovation. Driven by the vision of a trustless internet, we build foundational protocols to redefine value exchange and collaboration in Web3.

# Silva Protocol
Incubated by Silva Labs in 2023, Silva Protocol is pioneering Finality-as-a-Service (FaaS) to revolutionize Ethereum's scalability and interoperability. By delivering a standardized fast finality confirmation layer, we address two critical challenges: finality delays in Layer 2 solutions and chain fragmentation across the omnichain ecosystem.
